Gym lift progress calculator

This a progress tracker for your lifts to see where 
you are at in terms of progress. This can be used to 
see how far along you are towards your lifetime goals, 
or can be used to see what is furthest behind compared
to your other lifts. This will help you determine what 
you need to specialize in terms of your next training
program. 

This is also used for the purpose of determing where 
your numbers would be at if you go to a non free weight
gym, such as planet fitness, and your goal numbers are 
for free weight movements. 

Add on features:
- could include choosing your lifting goals and 
templates/ratios that would help someone determine them
  - (ex) 3:4:5 ratio for bench, squat, deadlift
  - (ex) 2:3 ratio for pull up to dip
  - (ex) if want an emphasis or have better leverages
    for certain lift, can modify the ratios
    (ex) determine what is classified as beginner,
    int, adv, and elite and define what each of those
    mean
